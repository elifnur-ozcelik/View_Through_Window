# View Through a Window

**Created by: Elifnur Ozcelik**

## Description
This project is developed using OpenGL and the GLUT library. It creates a window scene with a view of the sky and a mysterious UFO.

- Pressing the left mouse button toggles the visibility of a surprise alien character.
- Pressing the spacebar starts/stops the UFO animation.
- The UFO moves continuously across the window from left to right.
